## What's EfficientClub ?

The most important _asset_ in one's life is their __time__ - the one thing no money can buy.

I care about optimizing _the right things_, so that I can spend more time on what I really want. More time with the people I love. More time for my curiosity. Health. Spirituality. Investments. Travel.

I started __EfficientClub__ to look for ways to be more efficient at life.

We will talk __work, productivity, routines, health and wellness, planning, entrepreneurship, finance__.
