# What's EfficientClub ?

The most important _asset_ in your life is your __time__ - the one thing no money can buy.

__EfficientClub__ was born of the need to optimize all the little things, so that you can spend more time on what you really care about. 

More time with the people you love ? More time for your passions ? Your health ? Your spirituality ? I believe all of that can be achieved through lifelong learning on how to make the different parts of one's life... more efficient.

We will talk __work, productivity, routines, health and wellness, planning, entrepreneurship, finance__.

## How to consume EfficientClub ?

The best way is to subscribe to the newsletter, and never miss an important bit again.
