## What's EfficientClub ?

The most important _asset_ in your life is your __time__ - the one thing no money can buy (as of 2017).

I started __EfficientClub__ to talk about optimizing _the right things_, so that you can spend more time on what you really care about. 

More time with the people you love ? More time for your passions ? Your health ? Your spirituality ? Be more efficient at your life to get more time for all of these.

We will talk __work, productivity, routines, health and wellness, planning, entrepreneurship, finance__.

I'll also make sure that you can consume each piece (or at least the gist of it) in less than 5 minutes.
